### Hello👋
I am currently a PhD studnt at University of Houston, majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.
I am passionate about modeling and solving complex operations research problems. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are also my favorite topics which I use frequently in my research projects.

These help you to know me better:
- 👩🏻‍💻 Commitment to my role is my most prominent characterisitc
- ❕ I am neither an introvert nor extrovert, I am ambivert
- 🧢 I beleive everyone should have a routine activity outside work, for me is street dancing
- 🥾 Hiking is my favorite hobby, of course hiking in mountains covered in snow
